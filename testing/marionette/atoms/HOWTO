These atoms are generated from the selenium trunk. They are minified versions of what's in the trunk,
optimized to run on Firefox. To generate them, clone the repo:

    svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ selenium-read-only 

then run the Google closure compiler and specify which atom you'd like to get.
For example, this will generate the "get_text" atom:

    cd selenium-read-only
    ./go //javascript/webdriver/atoms:get_text:firefox

This generates the atom, which is a function. You'll need to assign that function to a variable of your choice 
which you can then import, i.e.: you'll need to modify the atom with a variable assignment:

  var myVar = <atom code>

You can now import this atom and call it with myVar(). Please note the name of the function as a comment above this line to help readability in the atoms file.
